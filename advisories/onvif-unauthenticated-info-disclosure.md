**Researcher:** Bill Swearingen, Trifident Security (hevnsnt@gmail.com)
**Vendor:** Anjvision / Anjoy Technology
**Product:** Anjvision ODM IP camera firmware
**Affected versions:** all builds through V3.4.0.10
**Weakness:** CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)
**CVSS 3.1:** 7.5 High (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
**Status:** CVE ID requested from MITRE CNA-LR. Coordinated disclosure in progress.

## Summary

The ONVIF service discloses the device serial number, firmware version, model, and
MAC address without authentication. The serial number is the input to the vendor
super-password derivation. The serial-to-MAC mapping is partially reversible, so
the serial can be recovered from the leaked MAC address, defeating mitigations that
merely hide the serial.

## Affected products

Anjvision / Anjoy Technology ODM IP camera firmware shipped under 20+ brands
(ANPVIZ, SV3C, GWSecurity, Faleemi, KKB, CCDCAM, Sannce, Loosafe, Hiseeu, Eyoyo,
Jennov, and others). Confirmed on ANPVIZ IPC-D3243W-S V3.4.0.10.

## Technical details

Full technical details, affected binary offsets, and proof-of-concept code are
withheld from this public page pending coordinated disclosure. Vendors and CNAs
may request the complete technical package by contacting hevnsnt@gmail.com.
